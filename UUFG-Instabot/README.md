Let me introduce you to my first project on Web-automation and Web-scraping using Javascript and Puppeteer library. 

It goes by the name "UUFG - Instabot". It is based on the idea of Unfollowing the Unfollowers and Following the Ghost followers. 

As we all know #instagram doesn't have this feature of checking the people who have unfollowed us, and the people who follow us but we don't follow them. So this project will help the new coming influencer pages to manage their social media handle in a better way.
