I am very happy to introduce you to my first project for a #hackathon organized by #pepcoding on the topic of #webautomation and #webscraping using #javascript and #puppeteer library. 

It goes by the name UUFG-Instabot. It is based on the idea of Unfollowing the Unfollowers and Following the Ghost followers. 

As we all know #instagram doesn't have this feature of checking the people who have unfollowed us, and the people who follow us but we don't follow them. So this project will help the new coming influencer pages to manage their social media handle in a better way.

Special thanks to bhavesh bansal sir and Sumeet Malik

 sir for inspiring me to participate and their constant guidance and support.
